# goodguide/base-ruby

This is a Docker base image meant to provide a solid base from which to build, when you need to run a Ruby app in docker.

Each ruby lives in its own branch (see `REPO.md` for details), so see the
branches for available rubies.

This repo is tied to the [goodguide/base-ruby](//registry.hub.docker.com/u/goodguide/base-ruby) automated build on the Docker Hub. The master branch is **not** built.
